[FineTypes][] is an interface description language (IDL) focussing on types.

The `fine-types-core` package defines the core data types and functions — and it includes machine-checked proofs!

The proofs are written in Agda and the code is exported to Haskell using [agda2hs][].

The repository layout includes:

* `./src/agda` — Agda source code with proofs.
* `./src/haskell` — Haskell source code that was **autogenerated** from the Agda code. These files are still checked into the repository.
* `./generate-haskell.sh` — Script which uses [agda2hs][] to generate the Haskell source code. Run this script whenever you change the Agda source.
